# About

This is something as unusual as a personal website. Somewhere for me to write my thoughts on things that are relevant to me. It's not a blog, I'll try to keep ramblings to a minimum, but rather a repository of what I (should) know about computers.

These are the pages on wich I intend to write my purpose. My attempt to contribute to the world and the internet. If I've ever had a hard time googling a problem, I shall make a note of it on these pages, and write down what worked for me.

## Notes to self

I used to run a photo blog, nothing big but I had a lot of fun. I made this one page with deveopment times for different kinds of film and developers. I looked up that page so many times.

That's the idea with my "Notes to self" section. If I have a problem with something, or must remember something technical for later, I'll post it there.
