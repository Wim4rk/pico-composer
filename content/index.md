# Wim4rk

Welcome to this embryo of a website. Right now, I just hope you find it
readable. Eventually I shall make it beautiful, but let's start like this,
with an early eighties monitor theme.

This is how it usually starts for me, in the terminal, setting up the back end,
making scetches and planning the project ahead. I actually feel this black and
green screen is very inspiring.

## What is Wim4rk?

It's actually me. Or, just me, perhaps? I'm a flegling junior full stack developer
trying my wings. I'm not even sure if I'm going to make all of this my carreer.
At the moment I'm mostly having fun. Testing stuff out.
